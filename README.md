# Movie Moods

> Movies to match your moods.

We feel like the genres of movie films are sometimes broad. We realize we spent hours just to scroll and decide what to watch. This app is intended to help people browsing movies based on the moods.

Are you in the mood for a movie with great jazz soundstracks, or a slow-paced, relaxing day as if you are in a Scandinavian country? Or, are you just ready to forget everything and laugh? Find the movie to watch today.

Also, if you have favorite movies that you always watch for each specific mood, add them with your special moods and share with people.
